#StalkActiveUsers
================

Throw a youtube video (ex.: B8pmHntH7II) or entire video-link as argument, and this Ruby-script returns all the commenters that wrote on that video. Ever wanted to message people, who actually give feedback on videos, that are of the same genre as yours? I grant you the power!

##Example
================
```
ruby StalkActiveUsers.rb eClVIBPQvXA
```
Returns a list of all (unique) commenters on that video.

or

```
ruby StalkActiveUsers.rb http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=eClVIBPQvXA
```
